    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        <p>Oct 23, 2025</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an 18, nearly 19 year old student, as of writing, and I&rsquo;m pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I&rsquo;ve been coding for quite some time now,
working on all sorts of varied projects, my favorite language has to be C++, simply because of its versatility</p>
<h1 id="my-story">My Story</h1>
<p>I started programming in middle school, doing your typical block coding and dipping my toes into js and html, it wasn&rsquo;t a very in-depth
start to coding but it got me interested. I still remember in I believe 7th grade, I had recently gotten a new desktop computer and decided to
overclock it, at first I just messed with the CPU&rsquo;s clock speed, nothing crazy. However, I eventually decided to mess with my RAM&rsquo;s timings
and voltage, which ended about as well as you&rsquo;d expect. Forcing me to hard reset the bios to even get a light to come on again.</p>
<p>From then on I was thoroughly invested in computers, in high school I started by taking the intro to CS class, which taught C++, it was a difficult
class but incredibly rewarding, and the next year I decided to take AP CS. It was near the end of this year that I really started to get into CS as
a whole, the class was taught in Java and I got to expand my knowledge so much more, the thing that really got me hooked however was this one
project we had to do which involved mapping edit distances between words and finding a path between them. Pretty basic in concept but it had numerous
directions youy could take it. I grew truly invested in this project and specifically in optimizing it, getting the code to run just that much faster.
It became an addiction.</p>
<p>Moving into my next year I took Game and App Development, a much more hands off class that allowed the student to explore in directions that interested
them. Here, is where I truly managed to develop my skills.</p>
<p>Starting at the beginning of the year, I worked on my Conways Game of Life implementation in Unity, at first it used GameObjects and other such slow
methods to run. However, once a mentor of mine made me aware of Compute Shaders, I pivoted. Up until now my coding career had been entirely on the CPU,
I was unaware of concepts related to GPU programming and the many different performance traps it contained, but I would soon be made well aware. It
took quite some time to get everything working properly, but once it was I was free to yet again optimize, more and more and more. Using a 16385x9216
texture I could render roughly 150 million cells to the screen at roughly 50fps. Truly seeing the difference switching to a GPU solution for a problem
like this made, I realized how much more programming on the GPU could unlock.</p>
