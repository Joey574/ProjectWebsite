        <h2>Conways Game of Life</h2>
        <p>
            The famous Game of Life written in C# for Unity
        </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Contains not just Conways Game of Life but many other variations, things like highlife, and von neumann 
            neighborhood, which are decently well-known, and also has variations like infection, in which green cells
            can infect white cells, causing them to spread rapidly, and a battle mode, where red and blue battle on even 
            footing, as well as my personal favorite, wireworld, a turring-complete electrical wire simulation, quite a 
            joy to watch.
        </p>

        <h3>How it Works</h3>
            Probably the coolest part about this (at least to me) is that it's all ran on a single texture using a compute
            shader, written in hlsl. Now while this is probably an obvious solution to this problem for many, this project 
            was the first time I truly got into GPU programming. As such it went through many iterations as I improved as 
            a coder and I got to watch as my creation got faster and faster, able to simulate around 151 MILLION points at 
            40 fps on my 2060 Super, a graphics card that came out in 2019.
